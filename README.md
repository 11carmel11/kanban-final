Amazing, right?

The application can really do some cool stuff, like adding tasks, rewrite and edit, shift between lists
and more great features!


Awesome function:

**-** you can add tasks by typing in the relevant column and clicking add button!

**-** you can edit your added task by double-clicking it!

**-** when hovering on a task you can shift it to another list by alt+1(todo)/2(in progress)/3(done)!

**-** surely you can search between tasks in the search field!

**-** everything is being saved far away in localStorageLand!
for next time you would come and visit!

**-** clicking the clear button will clear your page from tasks!

**-** you can also save your current task's status in far far away apiLand by clicking save button!
and when you need it back, just click load!!

**-** if you've done with everything, click on clear all to enjoy a new, fresh start!


* if you feel creative, you can challenge yourself and play Tower of Hanoi!!! just add to todo list numbers 7-1 and try to move the tower to done by shifting between lists with alt+1-3...
